*monologue* is built with ease of use in mind, especially for non software engineers;
and works well even on very minimal exotic platforms such as Windows console terminals.

Why you should be using monologue
**********************************

The light from the most beautiful nebulae far up in the sky travels a long
time to reach us; likewise, it may be that a lot of computational time
separates you from the contemplation of an interesting result after you fed
a program heaps of data (for instance, modelisation with scikit-learn_).

It is good practice to impress the viewer with details about what's going on:
informative messages and/or progress information.
The purpose of this Python module is to help you do so.

If you use *monologue*, which is not a burden, your code will be more reusable, more embeddable!
