Don't use yet, unless you know what you're doing, because this is what's left to do:

* complete docstrings and doc; comply to joblib's doc style.
* maybe discuss some API improvements
  * why not make a ProgressAndLog.progress member to hold all accessors regarding progress?
  * maybe think of the same for log files.
  * maybe some methods/attrs renaming should occur.
